# O365MailboxReport-Runspaces
Exchange Online mailbox folder size report that uses PowerShell runspaces. The report includes email address and mailbox, archive, and recoverable items total size. I used it address an issue with our retention policy causing the recoverable items folder to hit the quota limit. Mailboxes that hit their recoverable items quota limit were given archives. It can process 200k mailboxes in about 8 hours with an 8 core Xeon processor and 32GB RAM.
