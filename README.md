# O365MailboxReport-Runspaces
Exchange Online mailbox folder size report that uses PowerShell runspaces. The report included email address, mailbox, archive, and recoverable items total size. I used it address an issue with our retention policy causing the recoverable items folder to hit the quota limit. Mailboxes with a large amount of recoverable items were given archives. It can process 200k mailboxes in about 8 hours with an 8 core Xeon processor and 32GB RAM.
